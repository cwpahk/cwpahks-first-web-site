         <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>The main trick with JavaScript is to avoid taking the easy path.
            JavaScript is a wonderfully versatile language and as the 
            environment it is executed in is very forgiving it is easy to 
            write sloppy code that seemingly does the job. This same code 
            however will come back to bite you a few months down the line.
        

            JavaScript development has mutated from a fringe knowledge 
            area to an absolute necessity if you want to have a job as a 
            web developer. If you are starting right now you are lucky, 
            as myself and many others have already made most of the mistakes
            and done all the trial and error self-teaching; we can now pass
            that knowledge along.</p>
